	  <h3>Airplane Packing List?</h3>
	  <p>Sure, there are plenty of packing lists out there for remembering things like passports, deoderant, and children.  So now you are on the        airplane and you may be missing a few things you didn't even know you needed.</p>
	 </div>	  
	<div class="list-group">
      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Snacks</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Yes, you can bring food on the plane!  Please do so, airlines often do not offer any snacks.  On-board delays and tight connections can make a long day and you don't want to be <a href = "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hangry" target ="_blank">'hangry'</a> on top of that.  All food is acceptable incuding fruit and vegetables.  Just be sure to finish or dispose of them before going through customs.  Even if you aren't hungry, bringing snacks is like having good insurance.</p>
	  <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Empty Water Bottle</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Since your allowable 3 oz water bottle won't last your thirst past the security checkpoint, bring your favorite spillproof water bottle and fill up from the drinking fountains in the airport.</p>
	  <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Noise Canceling Headset/Ear Plugs</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Got the dough?  Spring for the first.  Got $.50?  It could be the best you ever spent if you want to catch up on some zzz's.  Throw in an eye patch for good measure since you'll most likely get the neighbor who won't lower the window shade. </p>
	  <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"?>Slippers/Extra Socks</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">For long haul flights, this is a must.  Your feet tend to swell at cabin altitude for extended periods of time making your shoes uncomfortable.  Give your toes some extra room, and protection when walking around on questionable airplane floors.  Also great for summer travel when you just have to wear your flip flops and your plane has arctic floor temps. You will be so enthused that your travel-savvy self remembered to pack wool socks in your carry-on.</p>
	  <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Scarf/Sarong</h4>
      <p class="list-group-item-text">Probably the most versatile piece of clothing you can pack.  For backpackers this can be indespensible.  Going to the beach : Towel.  Cold airplane: Blanket.  Going out for the night: Fashion Statement!</p>
